# EBAC Back-End Course - Java

Welcome to my repository for the **EBAC Back-End Development Course**, where I share tasks and projects developed throughout the course. The repository showcases my journey and progress in mastering back-end development using Java, including concepts, tools, and best practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

### Programming Fundamentals:
- Logic programming in **Portugol**, **C**, **C++**, and **Java**.
- Algorithms and basic API usage.
- Installation and configuration of **JDK** and **OpenJDK** (Windows and Linux).
- Setup and shortcuts for IDEs: **NetBeans**, **Eclipse**, **IntelliJ**, and **VSCode**.

### Core Programming Concepts:
- Variables and primitive types.
- Arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators.
- Control structures: **if/else**, **switch**, loops (**while**, **do-while**, **for**) and **break**.
- Arrays and multi-dimensional arrays.
- Complex types (Wrappers), **Boxing**, **Unboxing**, and **Casting**.

### Object-Oriented Programming:
- Classes, attributes, and methods (including **varargs**).
- Access modifiers (**private**, **public**, **abstract**).
- Constructors, **getters** and **setters**, **static** members.
- Core OOP principles: **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, **Interfaces**, **Abstract classes**.
- **toString** method and usage of **Encapsulation**.

### Advanced Topics:
- Exceptions handling.
- Utility classes: **String**, **Wrappers**, **Calendar**, **LocalDateTime**, **Instant**, **Regex**, **Scanner**, **File**, **Path**, **BufferedWriter**, and more.
- Collections framework:
  - Lists (**ArrayList**, **LinkedList**) with sorting (**Comparable**, **Comparator**).
  - Queues, Deques, Sets, and Maps (**HashMap**, **TreeMap**).
- File manipulation and serialization.
- Design Patterns (GoF):
  - **Creational**: Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Prototype.
  - **Structural**: Adapter, Facade, Proxy.
  - **Behavioral**: Strategy, Observer, Template Method.

## üåü Competencies and Skills

- **Back-End Development**: Building scalable solutions integrating back-end with front-end.
- **Version Control**: Using Git for collaborative workflows and maintaining code integrity.
- **Data Structures**: Implementing efficient solutions using lists, sets, and maps.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Leveraging interfaces, inheritance, and design principles for robust systems.
- **Patterns and Best Practices**: Applying Design Patterns and Generics to write reusable, secure, and maintainable code.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`/tasks`**: Course exercises and practice problems.
- **`/projects`**: Larger projects demonstrating the application of course concepts.
- **`/notes`**: Personal notes and key takeaways from the course material.

## üèÜ Goals

This repository aims to document my growth in back-end development and showcase my abilities to potential recruiters. It demonstrates my dedication to learning and applying modern development techniques using Java.
